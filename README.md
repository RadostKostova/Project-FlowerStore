# FlowerStore - An e-commerce web application for flower shopping

## üå∫ Overview
FlowerStore is a MVC application built to manage an online flower shop. It allows users to browse a catalog of flowers, add products to their shopping cart, place orders and more. Admins can manage products, view customer orders, assign roles and etc. </br>
</br>

‚ö†Ô∏è _The web project is created for the Project-Defence assignment at SoftUni in ASPT.NET Advanced 2024 course. It's still under development!_

‚ö†Ô∏è OldMigrations.zip in FlowerStore.Infrastructure contains migrations. They are ignored by the project, but still saved as .zip file. The reason behind this is orphaned tables, old relationships and testing records clearing and etc. Upon running the application for the first time the database should be clear as possible without any orders existing.
